Last week, Alice bought a new car.
The car cost 30.000$, a fairly large sum.
Bob's car only cost 20.000$.
Alice bought the car at the Ford Dealership in Singapore. 
Bob bought his Toyota in Tokyo, before returning home.
The Toyota Corolla has a bright red color and 5 wheels.
After seeing Bob's new Corolla, Alice regretted buying such an expensive Ford.
